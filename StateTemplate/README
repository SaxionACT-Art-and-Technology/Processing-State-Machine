Introduction

The state machine helps developers to maintain more complex program while keeping
overview over the whole program. The template shows just three states and can be used
as a starting point for your own state machine programs.


States

Standby    - black background and waits for a keypress to go to the Attraction state.

Attraction - blinks the background and waits for a keypress
             if the mouse is in the lower half of the screen, it changes to the NIGHT

MovingBall  - displays a ball. The color depends on the mouseY position. The ball position
             depends on the mouseX position in a diagonal line.

as necessary.
