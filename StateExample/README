README file for the Saxion ACT processing State Machine Example

Introduction

The state machine helps developers to maintain more complex program while keeping
overview over the whole program. The example shows a number of possible states, each
showing certain specific features.


States

Standby    - black background and waits for a keypress to go to the Attraction state.

Attraction - blinks the background and waits for a keypress
             if the mouse is in the lower half of the screen, it changes to the NIGHT
            state, and otherwise it changes to the day state.

Night      - displays a moon depending on the mouseY position. At the lowest point
             of the screen it is new moon and completely dark. The moon moves opposite to
             the mouseX position in an arc. A keypress changes to the Movie state.

Day        - displays the sun depending on the mouseX position. At the edges of the
             screen it is twilight, in the middle it is day. A keypress changes to
             the Movie state.

Movie      - shows a movie and when finished changes to the City state.

City       - blends two pictures of a city depending on the mouseY position
             lower of the screens means more night visible. When a key is pressed
            it changes to the Standby state.



Tips & Tricks

The stateExample is quite elaborate, the StateTemplate is easier to start from when
building a new program.
