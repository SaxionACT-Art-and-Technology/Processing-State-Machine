README file for the Saxion ACT processing State Machine Example with Arduino

Introduction

The state machine helps developers to maintain more complex program while keeping
overview over the whole program. The example shows a number of possible states, each
showing certain specific features. The states are controlled with an Arduino.


States

Standby    - black background and waits for a button press to go to the Attraction state.

Attraction - blinks the background and waits for a button press
             if the LDR value is lower than 256, it changes to the NIGHT state
             and otherwise it changes to the day state.

Night      - displays a moon depending on the potmeter position. At the lowest point of
             the screen it is new moon and completely dark. A button press changes to the
             city state if it was not the previous state and the movie state otherwise.

Day        - displays the sun depending on the mouseX position. At the edges of the
             screen it is twilight, in the middle it is day. A button press changes to the
             city state if it was not the previous state and the movie state otherwise.

City       - blends two pictures of a city depending on the LDR value. A lower light
             value means more night visible. When the button is pressed it either changes
             to the Night or Day state whichever state was not the previous state.

Movie      - shows a movie and when finished changes to the Standby state.




Tips & Tricks

The StateExampleWithArduino is quite elaborate, the StateTemplateWithArduino is easier to
start from when building a new program.
